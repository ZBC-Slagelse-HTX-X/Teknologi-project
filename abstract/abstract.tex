\section{Abstract}
    This report encompases a full description of the Lectio application suite which is a complete IT-solution directed at the Danish High Schools. It allows for centralised data sharing in regards to homework, assignments and lecture management.
    It provides all of this in an asthetically pleasing shell which utilises state of the art design philosophy and technology behind the scenes to provide the user with a pleasurable experience which both respects the user and his time.

    The system is two-folded in that it both encompases software and hardware--hardware in terms of a door control system which utilises RFID-technology and advanced absence registration. 

    The document below is written in Danish and both documents and explains design choices, functionality and the software suite.
